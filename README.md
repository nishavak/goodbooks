GoodBooks
Problem statement
	With more than 4500 books being published daily, it becomes strenuous for the users to keep the track of the books to be read and find their next ideal book to read. GoodBooks is a web application for reading enthusiasts where they can get information about a book. They can have a peek at the summary of the book. Also, they can search for the books based on anything related to the book. New book arrivals are featured on the homepage. Furthermore, users after logging in, can provide feedback and thereby if they want, can review and rate the books. 
	Users can search for Books using Title, Tags, Authors and even Rating. They can add books to their read books list. The profile tab shows charts to visualize the users pique interest. Users can update their profile and can even delete it if they want to. Books are managed by admin.
